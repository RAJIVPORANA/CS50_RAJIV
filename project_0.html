<!-- create front end for google containing   atleast three pages GOOLGE, GOOGLE IMAGES, GOOGLE ADVANCED SEARCH -->

<!-- on top of each page are links to other two pages -->
<!-- rounded search bar with search button below the bar and centered -->

<!--  image search should take you to the image page of the search -->

<!-- advanced search should have the following 
          "all these words";
          "any of these words";
          "none of these words";
          "exact phrase or word";   

           all these should be left aligned and stacked vertically
           blue search and white text
           Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page.
           The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.-->
